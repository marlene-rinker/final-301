CHALLENGE 1 - Review

First, write a function called mapCurrentEvents that maps over the current events object, runs it through a constructor function and returns the resulting array.

The constructor function should be a stand alone function named Events and should have the following keys: 
* author
* categories
* summary
* img_url
* date
* title

Then, write an `/events` route with a callback function called getCurrentEvents.

Next, write a function named getCurrentEvents that takes in the request and response as parameters. This function should call the mapCurrentEvents function and send the result to the front-end.
